"""Harder problem set + an interleaved 'noisy preamble' loader.

The hypothesis split should win on is *context isolation*: when a stream is
mixed with off-domain noise, a generalist can spend tokens / lose precision
on the wrong frame. We simulate this with two harder mixed sets:

- mixed_hard:   trickier traps + a few multi-step problems
- mixed_noisy:  same problems prefixed with off-domain ramble that a
                generalist must wade through, but a specialist can ignore
                because the supervisor split prompt narrows scope.
