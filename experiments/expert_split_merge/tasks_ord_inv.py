"""Probe set 3 — directly engineered to make a generalist misread.

The trap pattern is the same in both subdomains: the question contains a
structurally-ambiguous phrase that flips meaning depending on subdomain.
A specialist whose prompt names the trap can disambiguate; the generalist
has to guess.

We use 'first/second' problems and 'rate problems' where:
  - in COUNTING (mode A) 'first' means ordinal, sequence-ordering
  - in INVENTORY (mode B) 'first' means initial-state, before depletion

This is contrived on purpose — we want a regime where context-isolation
plausibly helps. If split-style isolation can't help here, it can't help.
