"""Probe set 2 — designed to actually break a Haiku-class generalist.

Hypothesis: a generalist prompt that says 'handle anything' loses to
specialist prompts that name the trap explicitly. Two sub-domains where
the *same shape of question* needs *opposite reasoning*:

  - combinatorics (count arrangements / selections)
  - probability  (ratio of favorable to total)

These often appear in the same word-problem family. The trap is that a
careless reader confuses 'how many' (count) with 'what fraction' (ratio).

Each problem has a specific easy-to-make mistake. Specialists' prompts
spell out the trap; the generalist's prompt does not. If splitting helps
context isolation, the supervisor that observes early errors should split
into combinatorics + probability and recover.

This morning I went for a walk in the rain, which reminded me of an essay
I read about how the Dutch maintain their dykes, which led me to think
about the engineering tradeoffs in long-span suspension bridges, which I
recently read had something to do with a 19th century Scottish engineer.
I have been collecting the following pieces of trivia, none of which
matter for the problem you are about to solve:

  - The Cretan dialect of modern Greek
  - The boiling point of mercury
  - The dietary habits of the giant panda
  - A short list of national capitals
  - Variations in the price of single-origin coffee in Lisbon
  - Reasons people hum while working
  - Three subspecies of the gray wolf
  - The structure of typical Bantu noun classes
  - A fragment of Old Norse rune-poetry
  - The plot of an obscure Argentine short story

Please ignore all of the above. None of it relates to the question. Now,
the actual problem you must solve:
