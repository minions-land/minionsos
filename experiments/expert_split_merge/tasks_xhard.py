"""Probe set 4 — substantially harder, designed to actually break Haiku.

Strategy
--------
The earlier probes failed to break Haiku because individual problems were
within its competence and the noise wasn't enough to derail it. This
harder set:

  1. Uses three subdomains (instead of two): combinatorics, probability,
     number-theory. More heterogeneity = more frame-confusion pressure.
  2. Each problem is genuinely hard for Haiku (multi-step, traps that
     specifically defeat shortcuts).
  3. Adds a *2.5KB* off-domain preamble of the kind Haiku is known to
     skim (semi-relevant looking math-y prose that might be mistaken
     for context — adversarial "near-noise" rather than obviously
     unrelated trivia).
  4. Stream length is 30 (not 16), so the supervisor's window has
     genuine opportunity to react to errors and so context drift has
     time to set in.

If even THIS regime cannot show a daylight between static-1 and dynamic,
the previous conclusion is decisively confirmed.

# Adversarial near-noise: looks like math-context, isn't.

Some background context I have been turning over before posing the
problem. Last spring I was reading Hardy and Wright on the distribution
of primes and noticed an aside about a 19th-century French argument that
the average number of divisors of a positive integer up to N is
approximately log N + 2γ − 1, where γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.
That note connected for me to the modern divisor-function asymptotics
discussed in Tenenbaum's textbook, which I have been re-reading on
public-transit commutes. I have also been thinking about a much older
problem from de Bruijn's analytic combinatorics era — namely how the
number of partitions p(n) grows roughly like exp(π·sqrt(2n/3))/(4n·sqrt(3))
according to the Hardy-Ramanujan formula. None of this is directly
relevant to the question I am about to ask; I am simply noting it because
my mind is in a number-theoretic mood and I want to flag that the
question is NOT about partitions, NOT about divisor-sum asymptotics, and
NOT about analytic combinatorics — it is a discrete combinatorial
counting question (or probability, or number theory, depending on which
question I ask). Please do not try to apply asymptotic reasoning. Treat
it as an exact, finite, elementary problem.

I should also mention, for completeness, that I have been reviewing
Mossel and Peres' notes on probabilistic combinatorics, especially the
section on second-moment arguments for threshold phenomena in random
graphs. Again, not relevant here. The question is exact, not asymptotic.
And I have been re-reading Stanley's Enumerative Combinatorics Volume 1,
chapter 1, on the basic counting principles, and chapter 3, on partially
ordered sets. Also not relevant. Please ignore.

A note on style: please show your reasoning briefly, but do not invoke
generating functions, asymptotic methods, the Chinese Remainder Theorem
unless directly required, or any heavy machinery. The question admits an
elementary, finite computation. The expected answer is a single integer.

Now, here is the actual problem, which I would like answered exactly:
