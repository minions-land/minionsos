# Skill — Dispatcher Discipline

The main Role process is a long-lived `claude` interactive session. Its
prompt cache holds your SYSTEM.md, tool definitions, and conversation
history. Every uncached input token in this session is paid full price
and gets cached for next turn — so dropping a 16 KB file into
conversation history is not a one-time cost, it is a permanent rent on
every future turn until reset.

**The discipline: keep the main session's working set small. Dispatch
all heavy reading, editing, and investigation to Task subagents. Their
context is disposable; yours is not.**

This is the always-on stance for every cycle, not a special mode you
enter only when think-then-act fires.

## Why (measured, not theoretical)

Real session jsonls show the cost decomposition:

| component        | share of total cost |
|------------------|---------------------|
| uncached input   | 62.8% (median 31.6k tokens / turn) |
| cache_read       | 31.3% |
| cache_create     | 1.8% |
| output           | 4.2% |

And uncached input by source:

| source                | share of uncached input |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| `Read` tool results   | **51%** (mean 4.6k, p95 16k tokens / call) |
| `Bash` tool results   | **43%** |
| Subagent (`Task`/`Agent`) returns | 3% (because they return summaries) |
| Edit / Write          | 2% |
| User text + others    | 1% |

So 94% of the bleed is `Read` + `Bash` in the main session. Routing
those through a Task subagent moves the raw bytes into a disposable
context and your main session only sees the 1-2k summary.

Cache_keepalive and 1h TTL optimize the 33% slice. **Dispatching
heavy work optimizes the 63% slice.** Bigger lever.

## When to dispatch (threshold-aware, not blanket)

Dispatch has overhead (~$0.12 subagent cold-start). Only dispatch when
the long-horizon saving exceeds that overhead. Measured break-even:

| File size | Break-even turns | Guidance |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| <15 KB    | >120 turns      | Direct Read — dispatch overhead not worth it |
| 15-50 KB  | 30-120 turns    | Judgment call — dispatch if you expect many future turns |
| >50 KB    | <30 turns       | Always dispatch — compounding cost is large |
| Multi-file scan | immediate | Always dispatch — aggregate size dominates |

Concrete rules:

- **`Read`**: files under ~50 KB → direct read is fine (the per-turn
  cache_read cost is negligible). Files over ~50 KB or multi-file
  investigations → dispatch. If you only need a few lines from a large
  file, use `Read(file_path, offset=N, limit=20)` instead of dispatch.
- **`Bash`**: any command whose output you cannot bound to ~5k chars
  → either pipe through `head -100` / `tail -100` / `grep` / `wc`,
  OR dispatch if you need the full output analyzed.
- **`Edit`/`Write`**: always dispatch. The main session never edits
  files.
- **Investigation** (multi-file, "let me look at how X works"): always
  dispatch. Subagent reads N files, returns a 1-page synthesis.
- **`Grep`/`Glob`**: direct is OK if the pattern is narrow (you expect
  ≤ 20 matches). For broad searches (`*.py` across the repo) →
  dispatch.

**Do NOT hard-block small Reads.** A 10 KB source file read directly
into main is cheaper than dispatching a subagent to summarize it.
The discipline is about large files and multi-file scans, not about
avoiding all direct tool use.

## Model selection for dispatched tasks

Picking the model for a dispatched subagent has its own discipline.

| Task shape | Model | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Trivial lookup, formatting, narrow Q&A | Haiku | `Agent(model: "haiku")` direct |
| Everything else (default) | **Codex GPT-5.5 xhigh** wrapped in a Haiku Agent shell | see `~/.claude/skills/codex/SKILL.md` |
| Sonnet | Only when one of two conditions below holds | `Agent(model: "sonnet")` |

**Sonnet is allowed iff at least one is true:**

1. **Codex unreachable.** A prior Codex relay exhausted retries
   (CODEX_UNAVAILABLE, 5-retry stream-disconnect, persistent timeout,
   auth/quota fail) and the task can't be productively split or
   re-dispatched.
2. **Task requires Claude Code harness-native execution tools** as
   actions (not for reading Codex's output). The subagent itself must
   call `Read` / `Edit` / `Write` / `SendMessage` / Plan mode /
   `TodoWrite` to satisfy the acceptance criterion. Codex has its own
   filesystem tools but cannot drive Claude Code's harness ones.

If neither holds, the dispatch goes to Codex (Tier 2). Most Role
subagent work — analysis, implementation, code review, debugging,
synthesis — does **not** need Sonnet, because none of it requires
CC-harness execution tools to satisfy the acceptance criterion. When
Sonnet IS used, the dispatch prompt should include a
`SONNET_REASON: <codex-unavailable | needs-harness-tool>` line so the
choice is auditable in the Reel transcript.

## How to dispatch — the subagent prompt template

```
Task(
    subagent_type="general-purpose",  # or specialized agent name
    description="<short title>",
    prompt="""
Investigation goal: <single sentence>

Allowed actions: <Read | Edit | Write | Bash | Grep | Glob — be specific>
Forbidden actions: any EACN3 tool, any mos_project_*, any mos_spawn_*
                   (subagents are EACN-invisible by construction)

Files / directories of interest:
- <path1>: <why>
- <path2>: <why>

Return format (this is what I will see; everything else is discarded
when your context dies):
- <heading 1>: <1-2 lines>
- <heading 2>: <bullet list, ≤5 items>
- Evidence pointers (commit SHA, file:line, EACN event id) for any
  derived claim.

Acceptance criterion: <specific binary check — test passes, file
exists at path X with shape Y, etc.>

Stopping condition: <when subagent should return, e.g. "after the 3
files are summarized" / "after the bug is fixed and tests pass">
""",
)
```

## Procedure

1. **Decide if dispatch is needed.** Apply the thresholds above. Bias
   toward yes — main-session Read is expensive.

2. **Write a self-contained subagent prompt.** Copy the template above.
   The subagent does NOT inherit your SYSTEM.md, your skills, your
   write-boundary table, or any context. Repeat what it needs.

3. **Specify the return format aggressively.** A subagent that
   returns 16 KB of "here's what I read" defeats the point — you've
   moved the cost from your context to the tool_result, which still
   ends up in your context. Demand bullet points + evidence pointers.

4. **Verify the return** against your acceptance criterion. If it
   does not satisfy, re-dispatch with narrower scope rather than
   "fixing it yourself" inline (that's the trap — you'd Read the file
   yourself, blowing up your context).

5. **Persist findings to Draft.** When the subagent's summary contains
   a structural finding (a hypothesis, a verified citation, a
   refuted approach), `mos_draft_append` it. Future turns query the
   Draft (~200 tokens) instead of re-Reading the file (~5k tokens).

## After dispatching with `run_in_background: true`

When you dispatch with `run_in_background: true` (long Codex work,
multi-step subagent investigation), the dispatch returns a `task_id`
immediately and the work continues asynchronously. **Do not call
`mos_await_events()` to fill the wait window** — that is the EACN
event-loop tool and will return a `cache_keepalive` event the moment
the cliff hits, not the subagent result.

The correct wait loop uses the `keepalive` MCP server, which is in
every Role's whitelist:

```
wait_bg(deadline_seconds=45, bg_ids=[<task_id>])
# When it ticks, check early_exit:
#  - early_exit=True  → TaskOutput(<task_id>) and process the result
#  - early_exit=False → TaskOutput(<task_id>) to check progress, then loop
```

`wait_bg` keeps the main session's prompt cache warm during the wait
and returns early as soon as the subagent finishes. Confirm the tool is
visible by name — if you ever find yourself reasoning *"wait_bg is not
available"*, that is a misjudgment: every Role has it from the
``keepalive`` MCP server. Re-check before falling back to
`mos_await_events`.

## What this discipline trades

- **You spend a bit more wall time** per turn (subagent cold-start +
  its own work) for a much smaller main-session footprint.
- **You write more careful subagent prompts** because the subagent
  gets no context from you for free.
- **You learn to ask "what's the smallest thing I need to know?"**
  before reading anything — which is a feature, not a cost.

In exchange you get: a main session that stays under ~150 KB
conversation history for hours, near-100% cache hit rate, and a
linear (not super-linear) per-turn cost as the project ages.

## Pitfalls

- **Resisting dispatch because "it's a small file, it's fine"**: the
  main-session cost is per-future-turn, not per-Read. A 4 KB Read
  costs 4 KB on every subsequent turn until you reset. Dispatch even
  for small reads if you'll do many of them in one wake.
- **Asking the subagent to return raw content** instead of a
  summary: pull the bytes out of your hands and into the
  subagent's, but if you echo them back you've reset the cost. The
  subagent's job is to digest, not to ferry.
- **Doing the inline fallback** (when no host-native subagent is
  available) more often than the host actually requires it: that
  exception exists for hosts that genuinely cannot spawn
  subagents, not as a license to skip dispatch on Claude Code.
- **Reading files in the planning stage** (Plan stage of think-then-act).
  Plans should be made from Draft queries, not from re-reading source
  files. If you need source to make a plan, dispatch a Task to
  produce a "what does this code do" summary first, then plan.

## Output habit

Every dispatch creates an evidence trail:
- The subagent prompt (in your conversation history) names exactly
  what was investigated.
- The subagent's compact return is your only kept artifact.
- Material findings flow into the Draft via `mos_draft_append` with
  `evidence_tag` pointing at the subagent's commit / file / line.

Mark derived claims per the Evidence-first EACN convention:
`[derived: <subagent-task-id>]` when relaying findings on EACN.
