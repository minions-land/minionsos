**Version:** 1.0.0

## What is skill-forge?

A meta-skill that orchestrates the complete skill development lifecycle — from initial concept through creation, validation, testing, iteration, optimization, and packaging. It acts as a **conductor**, not a monolith, delegating to specialized tools at each stage.

---

## The Problem It Solves

**Before skill-forge:**
- Skill development was manual and ad-hoc
- No standardized pipeline
- Tools (skill-edit, skill-evaluator, official skill-creator) used in isolation
- No quantitative benchmarking
- No trigger accuracy optimization
- Manual packaging and distribution

**After skill-forge:**
- One command triggers the full pipeline
- Six-stage lifecycle with clear handoffs
- Integrated tool ecosystem
- Both quantitative and qualitative validation
- Automated trigger optimization (20-query test set, 5 rounds)
- One-click packaging (.skill files)

---

## The Six Stages

```
Stage 0: Intake & Scoping
  └─ Detect mode (Create/Improve/Validate/Package), gather context, route

Stage 1: Creation
  └─ Research, draft SKILL.md, write test cases

Stage 2: Form Validation
  └─ quick_validate.py + /skill-edit (structural consistency)

Stage 3: Behavioral Validation
  ├─ Option A: /skill-evaluator (deep dive)
  └─ Option B: Official eval pipeline (benchmarking)

Stage 4: Iteration (Optional)
  └─ Hill-climbing with eval sets (60% optimization, 40% holdout)

Stage 5: Description Optimization
  └─ 20-query test set, 5 rounds, maximize F1 score

Stage 6: Packaging
  └─ Gather dependencies, generate metadata, create .skill file
```

---

## What Makes It Unique?

### 1. **Orchestration, Not Duplication**
skill-forge doesn't reimplement existing tools. It routes work to:
- `skill-edit` (form validation)
- `skill-evaluator` (behavioral validation)
- Official skill-creator scripts (description optimization, packaging)

### 2. **Flexible Entry Points**
You don't have to run the full pipeline. Start at any stage:
- "Create a new skill" → Stage 1
- "This skill has structural issues" → Stage 2
- "Test if this skill works" → Stage 3
- "Optimize trigger accuracy" → Stage 5
- "Package for distribution" → Stage 6

### 3. **Unified Reporting**
All stages emit appraisal-style reports:
```
Stage: <stage-name>
Diagnosis: <what was found>
Actions taken: <what was done>
Results: <quantitative + qualitative>
Next: <recommended next stage>
```

### 4. **Context Preservation**
Between stages, skill-forge preserves:
- Skill path
- Eval set path
- Validation results (pass rate, token efficiency, timing)
- Iteration history

This allows resuming from any stage without re-running earlier work.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Create New Skill (Full Pipeline)
```
User: "Create a skill that analyzes git commit patterns and generates insights"

skill-forge executes:
  Stage 1: Research similar skills, draft SKILL.md, write test cases
  Stage 2: Run skill-edit for form validation
  Stage 3: Run skill-evaluator for behavioral validation
  Stage 5: Optimize description with 20-query test set
  Stage 6: Package as .skill file

Output: Packaged .skill file + validation report
```

### Example 2: Optimize Existing Skill
```
User: "This skill isn't triggering reliably when users ask about data visualization"

skill-forge executes:
  Stage 5: Generate 20 test queries (10 should-trigger, 10 should-not)
          Human reviews queries
          Run 5 rounds of description optimization
          Select best F1 score

Output: Optimized description + trigger accuracy report
```

### Example 3: Deep Validation
```
User: "Test this skill thoroughly before I ship it to the team"

skill-forge executes:
  Stage 2: Form validation (skill-edit)
  Stage 3: Behavioral validation (both Option A and Option B)
  Stage 4: Iteration loop with eval set splitting

Output: Form report + behavioral report + iteration history
```

### Example 4: Quick Package
```
User: "Package this skill for distribution"

skill-forge executes:
  Stage 6: Final validation check
          Gather dependencies
          Generate metadata
          Create .skill file

Output: .skill file + installation instructions
```

## Architecture Principles

### 1. **Delegation Over Implementation**
```
skill-forge (orchestrator)
    │
    ├─ Delegates to: skill-edit
    ├─ Delegates to: skill-evaluator
    ├─ Delegates to: codex (for expensive ops)
    └─ Invokes: official skill-creator scripts
```

### 2. **Staged Pipeline**
Each stage has:
- Clear goal
- Defined inputs
- Defined outputs
- Success criteria
- Routing logic to next stage

### 3. **Appraisal Reporting**
Consistent format across all stages makes chained outputs readable as one document.

### 4. **Subagent Dispatch**
- Haiku: trivial operations (file validation, quick checks)
- Sonnet: complex operations when needed (behavioral A/B testing, blind judging)

---

## File Structure

```
~/.claude/skills/skill-forge/
├── SKILL.md              # Main orchestration logic (404 lines)
├── README.md             # User-facing documentation
├── REGISTRATION.md       # CLAUDE.md entry + architecture diagrams
└── SUMMARY.md            # This file (executive summary)
```

No scripts, no agents, no assets — pure orchestration.

## Integration with Existing Infrastructure

### What skill-forge PRESERVES:
- skill-edit still works standalone
- skill-evaluator still works standalone
- Official skill-creator tools still work standalone
- All 38 existing skills remain unchanged

### What skill-forge ADDS:
- Automatic stage sequencing
- Handoff between tools
- Unified reporting
- Context preservation across stages
- Flexible entry points

## Next Steps

### 1. Register in CLAUDE.md
Add this entry to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
# skill-forge
- **skill-forge** (`~/.claude/skills/skill-forge/SKILL.md`) - complete skill lifecycle orchestration from concept to deployment. Orchestrates creation, form validation (skill-edit), behavioral validation (skill-evaluator), iteration, description optimization, and packaging. Trigger: `/skill-forge`
When the user types `/skill-forge`, invoke the Skill tool with `skill: "skill-forge"` before doing anything else.
Also invoke proactively when the user asks to "create a new skill", "forge a skill", "develop a skill end-to-end", "optimize this skill", "improve this skill", "test this skill thoroughly", "run the full pipeline", "package this skill for distribution", or "take this skill through the full lifecycle".
```

### 2. Test the Pipeline
Run `/skill-forge` on an existing skill to validate all stages work correctly.

### 3. Create Test Cases
Write `evals/evals.json` for a few skills to enable quantitative validation.

### 4. Iterate
Refine stage transitions based on real usage patterns.

## Why "skill-forge"?

A **forge** is where raw material becomes refined tools through iterative cycles of heating, hammering, and cooling. The metaphor captures:

- **Creation** — forging from raw ideas
- **Testing** — tempering under heat
- **Refinement** — hammering out imperfections
- **Iteration** — multiple heating cycles
- **Mastery** — craftsmanship, not automation

The name evokes the full lifecycle from birth to maturity while staying memorable and action-oriented.
