# Skill — Think Then Act

Five postures available for planning non-trivial work at wake-up.
You decide which to use, how many, and in what order. The default sequence
below is a recommendation for when you are unsure how to start — not a
mandatory pipeline.

## When to consider this skill

- Wake delivers events requiring multi-step coordinated work
- You are uncertain about the right approach
- The work crosses boundaries (files, roles, experiments)

**Skip entirely** when the spec is concrete (file path + acceptance already
stated) or the task is trivial single-step. Don't audit premises the spec
already pins — that is ceremony, not thinking. Use one posture alone if
that is all the situation needs.

## The five postures (your toolkit)

| Posture | Skill file | Use when | Skip when |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Unstated Premises** | `unstated-premises.md` | Task has unstated constraints, or filling blanks with "obviously" | Spec is concrete and every premise verifiable from artifacts |
| **First-Principles** | `first-principles.md` | "Everyone does it this way" is the strongest argument | Routine engineering choice (lib, optimizer) where convention is load-bearing |
| **Dialectical Synthesis** | `dialectical-synthesis.md` | Two approaches conflict, or about to publish a confident claim | No genuine opposing position — manufacturing one is worse |
| **Goal-Setting** | `goal-setting.md` | About to dispatch work, need acceptance criteria | One-line binary check ("test passes") is sufficient |
| **Plan Persistence** | `plan-persistence.md` | Multi-step work (≥2 steps) that must survive context resets | Single-step task where dispatch alone is sufficient |

Each posture is an independent skill. Read its file when you decide to use it.

## Default recommendation (not mandatory)

For complex, ambiguous tasks where you genuinely do not know how to start:

1. **Unstated Premises** — surface what is NOT said
2. **First-Principles** — derive options from constraints
3. **Dialectical Synthesis** — model tensions between options
4. **Goal-Setting** — write the 5-element feedback loop (sensor / metric / threshold / feedback period / stop rule); not a verdict or MVP recommendation
5. **Plan Persistence** — write the plan to disk so it survives resets

Then dispatch. But this is ONE way to use the toolkit.

## Common failure mode — Posture 4 collapses into engineering conclusions

Synthesis (Posture 3) tends to end with "so we should build X". That is the recommendation, not the goal. Posture 4 must produce a Goal block in the canonical format from `goal-setting.md` — sensor, metric, threshold, feedback period, stop rule — that the executor can use as a stopping condition. "Can we build it: yes", "MVP scope is Y", "approach Z is impossible" are inputs to synthesis, not goals. If your Posture-4 output reads like an executive summary, a yes/no verdict, or an "工程性结论 / engineering conclusions" list, you skipped Posture 4 — open `goal-setting.md` and write the actual Goal block before dispatching.

## Other valid patterns

- **Just Goal-Setting**: Task is clear, you only need to define metrics before dispatch.
- **Unstated-Premises → Goal-Setting**: Premises are unclear but once clarified, the path is obvious.
- **First-Principles → Dialectical Synthesis**: You need to derive options and pick between them, but premises are already explicit and metrics are trivial.
- **Goal-Setting → Plan Persistence**: Task is clear but multi-step; persist the plan, then dispatch.
- **Unstated-Premises only**: You realize you cannot proceed and need to consult another role via EACN.
- **Skip all five**: The task is well-specified, the approach is obvious, and "test passes" is a sufficient goal. Just do it.
- **Goal-Setting → think-in-parallel**: Task is a hard single-point reasoning problem (math, algorithm, counter-intuitive logic); skip planning postures and go straight to parallel sampling.

The agent decides. The skill does not decide for you.

## After the postures: dispatch (never self-execute)

**Hard rule: the main agent is always a pure dispatcher, not just
during think-then-act.** It does NOT implement, edit files, run
commands, or produce artifacts itself — not even for single-step
tasks, not even for "just one quick read". All execution goes through
a subagent. This applies to every cycle, whether you invoked
think-then-act or not. The detailed thresholds (when even a `Read`
must be dispatched, what the subagent prompt should contain) live in
[`dispatcher-discipline.md`](dispatcher-discipline.md) — read it once,
then internalize it.

Why: the value of dispatch is context separation. The thinking
context stays clean for coordination; the doing context is disposable.
If the main agent both thinks and does, context bloats and the thinking
degrades on subsequent tasks. Empirical measurement on real Role
sessions: 94% of uncached input tokens come from `Read` + `Bash` tool
results in the main session. Routing those through subagents is the
single largest cost optimization available.

When you have enough clarity (from however many postures you used):

- **Write a plan**: Use Superpowers `writing-plans` if available, or write a markdown checklist.
- **Persist the plan if ≥2 steps** — read `plan-persistence.md`. Single-step work skips persistence — still dispatch.
- **Dispatch ALL execution** via one of (in priority order):
  1. `delegate-heavy-task` (Codex subagent) — preferred for implementation work.
  2. `subagent-driven-development` — when multiple independent tasks can parallelize.
  3. Host-native `Task` tool or `Agent` tool — fallback when Codex is unavailable.
- **If the dispatched answer returns suspect** (broken logic, contradictory reasoning, or two probes disagree): escalate to `think-in-parallel.md` — do NOT accept or fix manually.
- **Pass goals verbatim**: Copy your Goal-Setting threshold (specific numbers, not "a good report") into the dispatch as its acceptance criterion. No placeholders — "TBD", "reasonable", "appropriate" are plan failures.
- **After dispatch returns**: review the result, verify acceptance criteria are met, report completion. If criteria are NOT met, re-dispatch with corrective instructions — do not fix it yourself.

## Hard constraints

1. **Autonomous-only, evidence-first**: You cannot reach a human terminal. Messaging another role and exiting is a LAST resort — first try `codex` (read-only) or a `Task` subagent on the codebase, git history, EACN logs, and artifacts. Most "I need to ask X" questions are answerable from the repo. Only message another role when (a) the answer is a fact about that role's intent or external state that cannot be inferred from artifacts, AND (b) the role is reachable this wake. Never pause for human input.
2. **Time-aware**: The postures are thinking tools, not rituals. 2–8 minutes total, not hours.
3. **Evidence-marked**: Tag outputs per the Evidence-first EACN convention.
