# Skill — Citation Audit

Every bib entry checked at three layers: the work **exists**, the **metadata** matches canonical sources, the **context** in our sentence is something the cited paper actually establishes.

## When to invoke

- Once before any submission, rebuttal, or camera-ready.
- When Reviewer flags a suspect citation in `artifacts/reviews/`.
- When adding a batch of new citations late in the writing cycle.

Run after the draft is stable and numeric claims have been audited; before final compile for submission. Running too early wastes lookups on placeholder text.

## Structure

Per-entry verdict ∈ `OK` / `DRIFT` / `MISSING` / `WRONG_CONTEXT`. Outputs:

- `branches/writer/paper/CITATION_AUDIT.md` (human-readable per-entry list with verdict, evidence URL, sentence).
- `branches/writer/paper/CITATION_AUDIT.json` (machine: `{key, status, evidence_url, notes}` per entry).

Verification sources: arXiv, DBLP, ACL Anthology, OpenReview, publisher venue page, DOI resolver. Aggregator pages (ResearchGate, etc.) are not canonical.

## Procedure

1. **Gate timing** — after draft stable and numeric audit done; before final compile.
2. **Extract `(key, context)` pairs.** For every `\cite{...}` in `branches/writer/paper/`, record key, file, line, full surrounding sentence. Build inverse index (bib entry → cite sites).
3. **Verify existence.** For each entry, resolve arXiv ID / DOI / venue URL via web search. Unresolvable → `MISSING`.
4. **Verify metadata.** Compare authors, year, title, venue against canonical sources. Mismatch → `DRIFT`. Watch for arXiv v1 vs conference version title drift and year off-by-one on preprint-to-accepted transitions.
5. **Verify context.** Does the cited paper actually support what our sentence claims? Wrong-context (real paper, wrong claim) is the most dangerous class. Flag `WRONG_CONTEXT` with a one-line explanation.
6. **Record verdicts** in `CITATION_AUDIT.md` and `CITATION_AUDIT.json`. Every non-`OK` entry marked `[derived: web lookup <URL> @ <ts>]`.

## Pitfalls

- Pattern-matching from memory. Every verdict cites a fresh web source.
- Auto-"fixing" by swapping in a different paper without rechecking the context.
- Treating existence as sufficient — wrong-context is the failure mode that survives naïve audits.
